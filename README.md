# steganography_backend

The app will allow a user to upload an image, and enter a message to be hidden in that image. The app will generate a copy of the original picture with the encrypted message embedded into the imageâ€™s pixels. The modifications to the encrypted picture should not be noticeable. The user can then send the encrypted image to someone. The receiver can then upload the modified image app. The app will display the decoded message. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Setup and Installation

You will need the following installed locally on your machine:

- [ `pipenv` ](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) - It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well as adds/removes packages from your Pipfile as you install/uninstall packages. 
- [ `pyenv` ](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) - The use of pyenv gives us the ability to manage python versions

- [If you need more help with set](https://dev.to/writingcode/the-python-virtual-environment-with-pyenv-pipenv-3mlo)

### Coding Style
- VSCode
- [`autopep8`](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8) for Python. Ensure that it is installed on
your editor and that it is set to automatically format on save.
